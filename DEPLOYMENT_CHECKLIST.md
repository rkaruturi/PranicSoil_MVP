## Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Create Stripe Products (5 minutes)

**Create Monthly Product:**
```
Name: Pranic Soil Voice Assistant (Monthly)
Price: $29.99 USD
Billing: Recurring - Monthly
```
📋 Copy the **Price ID** → You'll need this for the setup script

**Create Annual Product:**
```
Name: Pranic Soil Voice Assistant (Annual)
Price: $299.00 USD
Billing: Recurring - Yearly
```
📋 Copy the **Price ID** → You'll need this for the setup script

### 2. Add Stripe Key to .env (1 minute)

Open your `.env` file and add:
```env
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY_HERE
```

⚠️ Get your publishable key from: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys

✅ Save the file

### 3. Run Setup Script (5 minutes)

Open PowerShell and run:
